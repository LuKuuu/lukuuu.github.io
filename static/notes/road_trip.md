# Road Trip

1. All in a sudden, I want to escape the current life I'm having
2. Vancouver is beautiful, but life has getting stuck for a while
3. Maybe, It's because it's the graduation season, and my life haven't have much changes for 1 year
4. Vacation and traveling is something I always want to do, and It's becoming more impossible as I'm getting older
5. I suddenly recalled one of my house owner said, she feel she is stucked in the house once she bought it
6. I guess it's always the case that I want to explore the US eadt coast, go to all the places I want to visit, universities, museums, and what's their life looks like
7. After being in Vancouver for a year, I want go get a life that I weak up in a different bed, in a differently life
8. Maybe I should get a tent lol, I don't even need to pay the hotels, and I can become homeless
