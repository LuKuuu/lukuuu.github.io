# Arena of Valor

1. I have played AoV almost every day for the last 7 years
2. I watch the Live/replay of the game to help me fall asleep. I can sleep almost within 5 minutes after I start watching, no matter how much sleep I have already. I guess I'll switch to the Golf contest once the game is dead
3. I once had a very good Vietnam friend, he can't speak English, but we spent at least 100 hours playing games together
4. I hate the Map Hacker, but I feel satisfied once I defeat them
5. How to play Kriknac: 1) Gain more gold at the beginning; 2) finish the game between 8 to 20 mins; 3) destroying towers is more important than killing enemies
6. How to play Maganga: 1) Build Magic at the beginning; 2) Build tank if the team has the advantage, otherwise build damage; 3) once you build everything, no one can kill you solely
7. How to play Iggy: Focus on their Maskman
8. How to play Tulen: Don't build life steal as the beginning
