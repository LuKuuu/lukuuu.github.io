# MBTI

1. I was identified as an INTP
2. Many of my friends are ENFP
3. I once talked with two ENFJs, I'm not sure if it's their individual or it's their personalities. I always find it interesting to talk with them, even if it's just a few times
4. Barry doesn't believe in MBTI, he thinks an in-depth analysis of hormones should give us more idea of the person's behavior/personality.
5. Eric doesn't believe in it as well, I think he lies in the middle of everything, and he shows different behavior patterns when it comes to different things.
6. I personally think the MBTI is a good thing. It helps you have a better understanding of yourself and gain confidence.
7. Surprisingly, most of my loved characters are not even "N", the only TV show I liked with lots of "N" is the Person of Interest.
8. Personality can also be a good excuse for doing/not doing something. For example, when I stay up late, I always forgive myself as "It's how an INTP behavior"
9. (I should learn more words, the article is so plain)
10. As an INTP, it's sort of a hint that I'm not good at leadership, especially when it comes to public speaking/display. I believe I can try to handle it, but I usually act weird, at least not looks like myself
11. MBTI meme is always interesting
12. To be honest, I do feel I'm more connected to cats than humans.
13.  (I'll write more when I have more thoughts, but I'm sort of brain-dead)
